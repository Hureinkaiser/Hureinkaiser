## Projects

### Secure Transit: A JavaFX Application for Transport Security Updates in Leeds
- Integrated TransportAPI for bus route details and the UK Police API for crime data.
- User-friendly interface, navigation controls, and threaded background tasks optimize the user experience.

### Product Management System: Informatics Project

- Data Entry Tool with Flask:
  - Created a user-friendly interface for seamless product data entry.
  - Implemented a data entry tool with Flask, preventing users from proceeding without entering essential product details.

- Flask Routes and Views:
  - Developed routes and views in Flask to render HTML templates, process form submissions, and manage the overall flow of the application.
  - Ensured a smooth and intuitive navigation experience for users interacting with the product management system.

- Validation Mechanisms:
  - Employed both frontend (client-side) and backend (server-side) validation to enhance data accuracy.
  - Frontend validation provides immediate feedback to users, enhancing the user experience.
  - Backend validation in Flask guarantees that the submitted data meets the required criteria, maintaining data integrity.

- Continuous Integration and Deployment:
  - Utilized continuous Oracle Cloud deployment practices for a seamless and reliable deployment pipeline.
  - Automated testing and deployment processes ensure a consistent and efficient workflow for maintaining and updating the product management system.


### Connect Four Game

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles:
  - Applied OOP principles, leveraging features such as polymorphism and inheritance to design and structure the Connect Four Game.
  - Utilized polymorphism to create a flexible and extensible codebase, allowing for the development of different game components with a common interface.
  - Implemented inheritance to establish relationships between classes, promoting code reuse and maintaining a clear and organized class hierarchy.

- Core Game Logic Implementation:
  - Implemented the core game logic, including the rules and mechanics of Connect Four, to accurately simulate the classic game.
  - Ensured that the game adhered to standard Connect Four rules, allowing players to drop discs into columns and win by connecting four discs of the same color vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.

### Bringing Colors to Life: A Fun and Interactive Arduino LED Project
- Developed a creative and interactive project centered around Arduino microcontrollers and LED technology.
- Prioritized accessibility by designing the project to accommodate individuals with visual impairments.
- Ensured that the project was inclusive and could be enjoyed by a diverse range of users, including those with varying levels of visual abilities.
 - Logic Gates and Truth Tables:
    - Incorporated logic gates into the project to perform digital signal processing and control the behavior of the LEDs.
    - Created truth tables to define the relationship between input signals and desired output states, facilitating the logical design of the project.
    - Implemented logical operations such as AND, OR, and NOT gates to achieve specific lighting patterns or color combinations.
 - Karnaugh Maps (K-maps):
    - Applied Karnaugh mapping techniques to simplify and optimize logical expressions.
    - Used K-maps as a visual aid to identify patterns and redundancies in the truth tables, streamlining the design process.
    - Optimized the logical design of the LED project to enhance efficiency and resource utilization.

  - Finite State Machines (FSMs):
    - Implemented Finite State Machines to model the behavior of the LED project as it transitions between different states.
    - Defined states, transitions, and actions to create a structured and modular design that can be easily extended or modified.
    - Utilized FSMs to add a dynamic and interactive element to the project, allowing for diverse and engaging LED sequences.
